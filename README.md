## 📝 Overview 📝
LockInAI is an application that uses machine learning to help users maintain focus when working. LockInAI uses a neural network on a video of the user to determine whether they are currently focused or unfocused on their task, using binary classification. What makes this project special is that it's able to determine focus or unfocus when the user is working on tasks off of their computer, like on paper. LockInAI also uses machine learning and advanced AR technology to allow for in-air gesture controls. Since getting on the computer can be a gateway for many distractions, by allowing the user to scroll or click just by swiping the air, it helps ensure that the user will stay on task.
